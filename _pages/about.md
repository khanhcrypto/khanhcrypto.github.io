I am broadly interested in mathematical aspects of cryptography. My current research focus is on constructing practically efficient lattice-based cryptographic schemes and protocols designed for real-world applications, such as anonymous credentials, electronic voting, and confidential payment systems.

I currently work as a lecturer at King's College London. Previously, I was a post-doc at EPFL, hosted by Alessandro Chiesa. I obtained my PhD degree at ETH Zurich and IBM Research Europe - Zurich, under the supervision of Vadim Lyubashevsky and Dennis Hofheinz. Before that, I did my undergraduate and master studies at the University of Bristol.
