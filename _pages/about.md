I am interested in mathematical aspects of cybersecurity, particularly around cryptography. My current research focuses are quantum-safe cryptography (particularly, from lattices and hash functions), privacy-enhancing technologies, zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain protocols as well as their real-life applications to establish various security features such as confidentiality, integrity, privacy, anonymity and accountability in practice. I have also worked on symmetric-key cryptography and classical public-key cryptography.

I currently work as a lecturer at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, where I also serve as the Deputy Course Director of Master of Cybersecurity and the Deputy Director of Post-Quantum Cryptography in the Indo-Pacific ([PQCIP](https://ocsc.com.au/pqcip/)) Program. Before that, I was a post-doc at Monash and CSIRO's Data61 jointly. I also did a research internship at IBM Research, Zurich, hosted by [Vadim Lyubashevsky](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-vad). I completed my PhD at Monash under the supervision of [Ron Steinfeld](https://users.monash.edu.au/~rste/), [Joseph Liu](https://users.monash.edu.au/~kailiu/) and [Dongxi Liu](https://people.csiro.au/L/D/Dongxi-Liu).

I organise Monash Software Systems and Cybersecurity (SSC) Seminars. If you are interested in cutting-edge research in cybersecurity, sofware engineering and data engineering, see [our website](https://www.monash.edu/it/ssc/seminars) for past and upcoming events.

I have **multiple PhD scholarships available**. Please refer to [supervision](https://mfesgin.github.io/supervision/).

This webpage is currently under development. If you spot any issues, please contact me via email (provided at the end of the page).
