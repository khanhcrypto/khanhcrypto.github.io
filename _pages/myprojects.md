The following are some of the major projects I am/was involved in.

1. Post-Quantum Cryptography in the Indo-Pacific (PQCIP) \[2022--2025\]: 
	- I am the Deputy Director of the PQCIP Program, which is an educational capacity-building initiative. It will train cybersecurity and information technology participants from organizations in 11 partner countries to understand and develop the capability to deploy NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standards, and help them protect against emerging quantum computing threats.
	- The project is funded by the US Department of State.
	- See [this website](https://ocsc.com.au/pqcip/) for more information.

2. Algorand Centre of Excellence on Sustainability Informatics for the Pacific (ACE-SIP) \[2022--2027\]:
	- This project involves several institutions across the Pacific and is led by Monash University. It aims to advance the state of the art in blockchain technologies and exploit their potential for a sustainable future. The project spans different clusters on research, education as well as community.
	- The project is funded by [Algorand Foundation](https://www.algorand.foundation/).
	- See [this website](https://ace-sip.org/) for more information.

3. Next Generation Graduate Program on Quantum Information Technology: Industry Readiness & Applications \[2023--2026\]:
	- This program aims to train the next generation experts on quantum information technologies. It is in collaboration with a variety of industry and university partners. 
	- The project is funded by CSIRO.
