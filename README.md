This project is forked from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/) to create my personal webpage. Please refer to the original al-folio template for details. The license statement is quoted below exactly as in the original al-folio project (at the time of writing, 20 Sep 2022).

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE). 

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
